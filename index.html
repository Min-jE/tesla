<p>The paydirt car for Tesla, a stylish mass-produced 200-mile EV 
(200 mile = 322 Km) : article from <a href="http://www.plugincars.com/tesla-model-3">PluginCars.com</a></p>

<p>Tesla would have to defy all expectations to achieve success on the Model 3, while avoiding all the potential pitfalls-not only for the 200-mile $35,000 Model 3, but a massive new battery factory, and the Model X that comes first. Can Tesla do it again? </p>

<p>As of March 2015, Tesla has not yet released any design renderings, or teaser images, of its third-generation “affordable” 200-mile car. Until an official unveiling of the Tesla Model 3, expected in 2016, the style of the car is pure guesswork. Even the name of the car is not entirely resolved. At the birth of the company, the project to create a lower cost mass-produced relative small car was called “Tesla Bluestar.” Elon Musk, the company’s chief executive, wanted to use “Model E,” for its name, but that conflicted with a Ford copyright. So Tesla shifted to “Model 3,” alternatively shown as the roman numeral for three, or three stacked horizontal bars.</p>
<p>We can look at the design vocabulary of the larger Model S sedan for the clues, but that should be counterbalanced with statements from Musk that suggest a significant departure not only from the Model S, but from the entire auto industry.</p>
  <p>“I really want the Model 3 to be different, not just a smaller Model S,” said Musk. The Model 3 will be 20 percent smaller than the Model S.</p>
    <p>Musk was speaking at the Automotive News World Congress in January 2015. Musk added that the car would be “way different from any other car on the road… [but] in a way that’s really useful and just doesn’t feel like a weird-mobile.” This is a veiled dig against electric cars like the BMW i3, which are iconoclastic but not entirely well received. The Model S has been universally praised as original, while derivative of premium vehicles from Aston Martin and Maserati.</p>
      <p>Innovations aimed at usefulness in the upcoming Tesla Model X are reportedly the cause of multiple production delays for the all-electric sport utility vehicle. For example, according to multiple reports, the use of “falcon” doors (that rise up rather than swinging open) have proven difficult to implement. As a result, Tesla faces a formidable challenge of balancing “difference,” classic good looks, and a practicality and lower cost than the Model S.</p>

<p>There’s even less known about the performance of the Model 3. It’s assumed that the car, like the Roadster and Model S that preceded it, will offer quick bursts of acceleration. High power delivery is a signature trait of a Tesla automobile. Again, this will be a balancing act—considering that the bogey for driving range is 200 miles. Producers of electric cars commonly use multiple modes, such as sport and efficiency, to meet range targets in an efficient mode, while giving drivers on shorter trips theopportunity for a sportier drive in a performance mode.</p>

<h3>
<a id="authors-and-contributors" class="anchor" href="#authors-and-contributors" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Efficiency/Range</h3>
<p>The target for driving range in the Model 3 is 200 miles. The wild card is the use of battery packs of multiple sizes. Prior to the introduction of the Model S sedan, Tesla said it would offer a 40 kilowatt-hour pack with about 160 miles of range—in addition to the 60 and 85 kWh packs it now offers. The 40-kWh option was later jettisoned, because of lack of interest. Achieving a 200-mile range will require a pack, most likely, at about 50 kilowatt-hours. It’s not yet known if 200 miles will be based on the smallest pack, or if it will fit within somewhere else in a set of options.</p>
<p>The key is cost, and the actual cost of a finished installed EV pack—on a per-kilowatt-hour basis—remains difficult to pin down. Some analysts believe that Tesla is already approaching a cost of $200 per kWh, which would put the Model 3’s pack at around $10,000. Tesla’s long-term goal of about 10 years is to use mass production at its Nevada-based factory to bring the cost well below this level. The timing is tricky, and Tesla could have to either take a loss on the first set of Model 3 models, or modify its initial price target.
<br><br>Yet, it’s important to note that Morgan Stanley analysts believe that the average transaction price—rather than the lowest base-level price—of the Model 3 will be closer to $60,000. In other words, Tesla could offer a 200-mile version of the car with minimal features, to make good on its cost-range promises, while selling the vast majority of Model 3 cars at higher price points (and profit margins).
<br><br>The main point is that, after about seven years of EVs in the $30,000 range offering about 80 miles of driving range, Tesla will lead the vanguard of longer range battery electrics that offer more than twice the distance on a single charge at nearly the same price.</p>
