<p>The paydirt car for Tesla, a stylish mass-produced 200-mile EV 
(200 mile = 322 Km) : article from <a href="http://www.plugincars.com/tesla-model-3">PluginCars.com</a></p>

<p>Tesla would have to defy all expectations to achieve success on the Model 3, while avoiding all the potential pitfalls-not only for the 200-mile $35,000 Model 3, but a massive new battery factory, and the Model X that comes first. Can Tesla do it again? </p>

<p>As of March 2015, Tesla has not yet released any design renderings, or teaser images, of its third-generation “affordable” 200-mile car. Until an official unveiling of the Tesla Model 3, expected in 2016, the style of the car is pure guesswork. Even the name of the car is not entirely resolved. At the birth of the company, the project to create a lower cost mass-produced relative small car was called “Tesla Bluestar.” Elon Musk, the company’s chief executive, wanted to use “Model E,” for its name, but that conflicted with a Ford copyright. So Tesla shifted to “Model 3,” alternatively shown as the roman numeral for three, or three stacked horizontal bars.</p>
<p>We can look at the design vocabulary of the larger Model S sedan for the clues, but that should be counterbalanced with statements from Musk that suggest a significant departure not only from the Model S, but from the entire auto industry.</p>
  <p>“I really want the Model 3 to be different, not just a smaller Model S,” said Musk. The Model 3 will be 20 percent smaller than the Model S.</p>
    <p>Musk was speaking at the Automotive News World Congress in January 2015. Musk added that the car would be “way different from any other car on the road… [but] in a way that’s really useful and just doesn’t feel like a weird-mobile.” This is a veiled dig against electric cars like the BMW i3, which are iconoclastic but not entirely well received. The Model S has been universally praised as original, while derivative of premium vehicles from Aston Martin and Maserati.</p>
      <p>Innovations aimed at usefulness in the upcoming Tesla Model X are reportedly the cause of multiple production delays for the all-electric sport utility vehicle. For example, according to multiple reports, the use of “falcon” doors (that rise up rather than swinging open) have proven difficult to implement. As a result, Tesla faces a formidable challenge of balancing “difference,” classic good looks, and a practicality and lower cost than the Model S.</p>
